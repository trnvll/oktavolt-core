I'm implementing RAG in my application and the idea is to turn structured data from a database into unstructured text data. I need a proper prompt for doing this that makes the result very clear and easy to use in conjunction with RAG for best possible performance. It will take all the data that is available from the database columns for a specific record and turn it into text. In this case, it's for a table "relationships", which contains the information of a user's relationships through their life; friends, romantic partners etc. The data will be typical data that is stored in a database for such a record. Please give me the prompt for it.
